### Chapter-1 : Set Theory
https://www.rareskills.io/post/set-theory

We will barely scratch the grammar (proofs and theorems) and emphasize the vocabulary of abstract math.
A set is a well-defined collection of objects. Where the abstract power comes from is that these could be anything and the rules we learn from set theory apply to them.
Sets do not contain duplicate items by definition, {a, a, b} is really {a, b}
* Set equality
* Cardinality
* countably infinite(ℤ) vs uncountably infinite(ℝ)
